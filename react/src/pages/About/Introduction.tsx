      Our goal is to gather books and create an area where all BASIS Scottsdale
      students can come check out books for their enjoyment. This will also
      serve as a resource center for students to acquire more knowledge about
      their fields of study. The library will be designed in a way where
      everyone will be be able to check out books for a reasonable time frame to
      ensure that all students have equal access to our catalog! We hope to see
      you there!
