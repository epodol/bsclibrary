      Our goal is to gather books and create an area where all BASIS Scottsdale
      students can come check out books for their enjoyment. This will also
      serve as a resource center for students. A library is a peaceful area
      where everyone can study. The library will be designed in a way where
      everyone will be able access it easily and have enough time to read the
      books they take out while making it fair to others. Everyone will be
      welcome!
