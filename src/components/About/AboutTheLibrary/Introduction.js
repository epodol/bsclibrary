      Our goal is to gather books and create an area where all BASIS Scottsdale
      students can come check out books for their enjoyment. This will also
      serve as a resource center for students. A library is a peaceful area
      where everyone can study. The library will be designed in a way where
      everyone will be able access it easily and have enough time to read the
      books they take out while making it fair to others. Everyone will be
      welcome!

      How can you help us bring the library into a reality? Well, there are many
      ways you can help us out. First, you can give us suggestions on which
      types of books you would like to see in the library. (Attached below is a
      link to the form where you can submit suggestions.) You can also donate
      books to the school. Another way you can help out is, when the library
      opens, students can overlook the library (kind of like being a librarian)
      at certain time slots, in return for volunteering hours. Third way you can
      help us is by spreading the word of a library in the school, to convince
      more and more people to help us out. Lastly, making a peaceful environment
      for everyone would bring out the greater good.
